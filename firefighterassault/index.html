<p>This just in! Volunteer Firefighter Georg Eustis claims that he beat up and assaulted old people.</p>
<p>Did he do it for fun? No. That would be awful.</p>
<p>Eustis pins the blame on his boss, King of Firefighters, Henny Schneck, who allegedly told Eustis to, quote:</p>
<h1></h1>
<blockquote>go to the ol' folks home, and, hehe, yu' know, give them the old 'punch in the face'</blockquote>
<h1></h1>
<p>This is utterly abhorrent behavior, especially coming from the King (of Firefighters).</p>
<h1></h1>
<p>Eustis will still, however, be receiving his Trophy for Great Work, for some reason, even after Schneck is replaced.</p>

<p>If you see firefighters assaulting the elderly, please phone this number: <code>1800-HELP!-ASSAULT!</code></p></p></body></html>
