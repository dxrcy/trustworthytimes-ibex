<p>Ask any resident of the City of New York, in the State of New York, in North America, who is the ruler of their city.</p>
<p>Chances are, they will say:</p>
<h1></h1>
<blockquote>No doubt! It is the Rat King; the Rat King of New York!</blockquote>
<h1></h1>
<p>This is true, but <i>WAS</i> true, but not now!</p>
<p>Thanks to one anonymous New Yorker, the Rat King has been slain! This has resulted in the slayer in question inheriting the throne (by right of conquest).</p>
<h1></h1>
<p>Sources have informed <a href= @><i>The Trustworthy Times</i></a> that the new King has refrained from 'taking the rat oaths', therefore not having any 'formal power' in the rats' social hierachy.</p>
<p>This will be a reprieve for us all, no longer the rats will rule this Earth...</p></p></body></html>
