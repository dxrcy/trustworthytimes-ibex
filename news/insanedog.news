Dogs are great.

They say that dogs are some people's best friends.

The tip is to ask the dog questions that will make them give you a secret.

Here are some questions to ask:

> Hello my friend. How are you?

> What is the day today?

> How would you divide the Middle East?

These are soundproof plans to get a secret.

The secret will be important.

The secret is that you are crazy.
