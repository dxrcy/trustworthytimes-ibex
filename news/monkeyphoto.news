The image pictured above, submitted by user `XLarge\_` on Rebbit has taken the internet by storm about how cool it is.

But recent evidence released by photography scientists say that the image might be faked!

Some conspiracy theorists have pointed out that '*MoNkE iS nOt ToMaTo!*' but these comments have been brushed off as just plain stupid.
