Ask any resident of the City of New York, in the State of New York, in North America, who is the ruler of their city.
Chances are, they will say:

> No doubt! It is the Rat King; the Rat King of New York!

This is true, but *WAS* true, but not now!
Thanks to one anonymous New Yorker, the Rat King has been slain! This has resulted in the slayer in question inheriting the throne (by right of conquest).

Sources have informed [*The Trustworthy Times* | @] that the new King has refrained from 'taking the rat oaths', therefore not having any 'formal power' in the rats' social hierachy.
This will be a reprieve for us all, no longer the rats will rule this Earth...
