> Mother Nature can suck it

Those where the first words I uttered as an infant. I do not like it one bit.

This summer it was hot enough to melt water, which is too hot for me, as my body is made of mostly water.

I thought to myself 'what can anyone do about this?', and then I thought again after that 'hmm...'.


Then I figured it out. I would beat up the physical manifestation of nature itself. I will plan it out. No, I already did.

I am currently writing this while driving towards the tornado pictured. Funny its called a 'tornado', when it barely even tornades. Weak.


Nature is so stupid an- %The author was sucked into the tornado, dying instantly.%
