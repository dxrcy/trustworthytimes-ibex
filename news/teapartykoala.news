An Icelandic man known only as *ɸɸ* has been discovered having a tea party with local koala for the second time in one month.
It is a First-Degree Felony in Iceland, but he has somehow evaded arrest all four times he has done it.

> Hungh!

That's what *Miekkoul Punce* (Aka *Uorg*), the town caveman said when we stole his club. Lol
