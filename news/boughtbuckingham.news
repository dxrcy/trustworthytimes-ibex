BuckingHam Palace, AKA \*\*\*\*ingHam Palace, is the home of the Queen of Bri%t%ain and her many friends.
As a national symbol of Big Castle, it is of course off the property market, for the most part, but local man known as Lawrence Hylda purchased this big house for just under $103.
But how did he do it, you ask. We asked him in this exclusive interview:

# Trustworthy Times Journalist Sir Reginald Fancybottom Esq.

> Hello there.

# Lawrence Hylda, new legal owner of the Royal Family

> Hi.

# Fancybottom

# Hylda

> So...

# Fancybottom

> Yeah, let's start this interview

# Hylda

> OK Yeah.

# Fancybottom

> So how did you buy the Palace?

# Hylda

> Idk man, it was on [www.Amazon.com | https://amazon.com], the best place to by anything from books to shoes, and I was looking at the great deals they had for buttons, and I saw BuckingHam Palace listed for $102 and 58 cents.

# Fancybottom

> Huh. I wonder what that was doing there on that website, which by the way, is a really great place to buy headphones

# Hylda

> Exaclty

# Fancybottom
