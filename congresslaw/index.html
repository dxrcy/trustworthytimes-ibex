We got word this morning from the most handsome Congress Leader Buddy Warren, who said that 'Everyone must now be nice'.</p><h1></h1><h1></h1><p>This includes old people, who are commonly not nice. Anyone caught yelling at people, showing rude gestures, or committing a hate crime will now be responsible for going to jail for at least 2 hours every day for a year.</p><h1></h1><h1></h1><p>This bill has been put in place to stop people getting sad for people yelling at them (Or so I've heard). This is a good thing!</p></p></body></html>
