<p>What in GOSH name!</p>
<p>Thinking has occurred in a total of SEVEN (7) people today, according to <i><a href= @>Trustworthy Times</a></i> researcher <i>Darius Horowitz</i> (Me).</p>
<p>This is utterly ABYSMAL for many reasons.</p>
<h1></h1>
<p>Firstly, it is not ethical for the Melomer Group, responsible for acts of people.</p>
<p>This is why we cannot let this happen again.</p>
<h1></h1>
<p>Secondly, you know, it's just, kinda annoying.</p>
<p>I'm not jealous.., I just wish that I was one of the people having thoughts.</p>
<h1></h1>
<p>Lastly, do seven people really have to be thinking?</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Now you are part of the problem.</p>
<p>Hey everyone, this dumb idiot is thinking.</p>
<p>Get outta here.</p></p></body></html>
